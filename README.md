# Zoomable

Zoomable is an android library working with Jetpack Compose and enabling contents zooming with pinch gesture.

Zoomable provides a simple Modifier extension function `Modifier.zoomable`.

Here is a sample code.

```Kotlin
Image(
    painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.penguin),
    contentDescription = null,
    modifier = Modifier.zoomable(rememberZoomState()),
)
```

## Usage

### Download

Zoomable is available on Maven Central.

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation "net.engawapg.lib:zoomable:1.0.0"
}
```

### Modifier function

You can use `Modifier.zoomable` to make contents such as an image zoomable.
The zoom state is managed in a `ZoomState` object that can be created via `rememberZoomState`.
If `contentSize` is set, the range of offset will be optimized for the specified size.

```Kotlin
val painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.penguin)
val zoomState = rememberZoomState(contentSize = painter.intrinsicSize)
Image(
    painter = painter,
    contentDescription = "Zoomable image",
    contentScale = ContentScale.Fit,
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxSize()
        .zoomable(zoomState),
)
```
